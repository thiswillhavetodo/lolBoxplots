		"mainText0":"Ah, hello there. You must be my latest assistant. Please, allow me to introduce myself.",
		"mainText1":"My name is Professor David Structo, and I am founder and C.E.O of Build A Monster Inc.",
		"mainText2":"Here at Build A Monster Inc. we don't want to build just any monster. We insist on building the best monster we can.a",
		"mainText3":"That means we test our monsters to breaking point and beyond. Then we gather up all that lovely, lovely data.",
		"mainText4":"Your job is to help me make sense of that data, and also clean up the mess.",
		"mainText5":"The latest batch of test data is on the screen. Let's take a close look and see how our monsters performed.",
		"mainText6":"Well, looking at the raw data in a table doesn't tell us much. We need a better way to show our data.",
		"mainText7":"Let's look at the monster lifetime data first. We'll use a stem and leaf plot to represent the information.",
		"mainText8":"Okay. We sort our values from smallest to largest. The stem on the left shows the tens and the leaf on the right shows the ones.",
		"mainText8_5":"Now we can see where the highest frequencies of monster lifespan are. As a little test, click to show me where that is.",
		"mainText9":"Correct, very well done. Okay, now let's take a look at the monster speed data.",
		"mainText10":"Oh dear. Well, that's no good at all. With such a small data range the stem and leaf plot doesn't tell us anything useful.",
		"mainText11":"We need to represent the data in a different way. Let's try a line plot instead.",
		"mainText11_5":"A line plot shows the frequency of data along a number line. We place an X at the correct place on the line.",
		"mainText12":"Now, that is much better. Can you click on the most common speed?",		
		"mainText13":"Good. Now we can start trying to improve on our monster formula. We will add ingredients to our secret formula and see what effect they have.",
		"mainText14":"Choose an ingredient to add.",
		"mainText16":"Now let's see the full set of results from our tests.",
		"mainText17":"Again, we need to show the data in a graph to make sense of it. Let's look at just the lifetime data.",
		"mainText18":"This data has quite a broad range. Which type of graph should we use?",
		"mainText19a":"Good, I think that's the best way to show this data.",
		"mainText19b":"Actually, I think a stem and leaf plot would work better here. Let's try that instead.",
		"mainText20":"Good. Much clearer now.",
		"mainText22":"Next, let's do the same with the new speed data. This time the range is quite narrow. Which graph type should we use?",
		"mainText23a":"Yes, that's a good choice of graph.",
		"mainText23b":"Again, a stem and leaf plot doesn't work well here. Let's try a line plot instead.",
		"mainText24":"Much better.",
		"mainText27a":"Well done, that's a good day's work. I look forward to seeing you again to test more ingredients.",		
		"mainText27b":"Excellent work. You've done all you need to today, but you're welcome to help test the other ingredients.",

		"possResponses1":"That's certainly an interesting choice. I do hope you're taking this seriously.",
		"possResponses2":"Not my first choice, but what's the worst that can happen?",
		"diffResponse1":"There's a definite improvement on the original formula. Good choice.",
		"diffResponse2":"Not much difference from our original formula, maybe a little higher.",
		"diffResponse3":"I can't really see that there's any difference from the original formula at all.",
		"diffResponse4":"Not much difference from our original formula, maybe a little lower.",
		"diffResponse5":"This is not what we were hoping for at all. The new ingredient reduced performance.",
		"finalResponse1":"So, we've finished testing and we can now say there's a definite improvement in monster life and a clear improvement in monster speed.",
		"finalResponse2":"So, we've finished testing and we can now say there's a definite improvement in monster life and not much change in monster speed.",
		"finalResponse3":"So, we've finished testing and we can now say there's a definite improvement in monster life and an obvious drop in monster speed.",
		"finalResponse4":"So, we've finished testing and we can now say there's no real difference in monster life and a clear improvement in monster speed.",
		"finalResponse5":"So, we've finished testing and we can now say there's no real difference in monster life and not much change in monster speed.",
		"finalResponse6":"So, we've finished testing and we can now say there's no real difference in monster life and an obvious drop in monster speed.",
